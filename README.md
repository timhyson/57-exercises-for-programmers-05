##Simple Math

You'll often write programs that deal woth numbers.  And depending on the programming language you usem you'll have to convert the inputs you get to numerical data types.

Write a program that prompts for two numbers.  Print the sum, difference, product, and quotient of those numbers as shown in the example output:

###Example Output

```What is the first number? 10```  
```What is the second number? 5```  
```10 + 5 = 15```  
```10 - 5 = 5```  
```10 * 5 = 50```  
```10 / 5 = 2```
